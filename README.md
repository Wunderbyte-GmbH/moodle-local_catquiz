## Detailed description ##

The plugin local_catquiz implements Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) in Moodle. Using static Item Response Theory (IRT) models, test takers are presented only with questions that fall within their identified ability range, based on the answers they give. This shortens the required test length and increases test accuracy.
The plugin can be used with all question types in Moodle that allow automatic scoring (e.g. multiple choice or cloze text). Depending on the question format, the plugin provides different IRT models:
* Rasch-Model (1 parametric logistic model)
* 2PL-Rasch-Birnbaum
* 3PL-Mixed-Rasch-Birnbaum
* Graded Response Model
* Generalized Partial Credit Model

In addition, the plug-in enables the creation, administration and modification of different scales on which measurements are taken. For this purpose, the plug-in creates a new role "Test Administrator", which is authorized to perform these administrative tasks for defined course areas.
 
The plugin is a central part of the CATQuiz plugin family. It is recommended to install the following plugins as well:
* mod_adaptive - the activity from which a CAT test can be started
* mod_catquizfeedbackgrouping - a text block that gives detailed feedback on a CAT test and optionally assigns users to groups according to this feedback
* task_catquizparamest - a background task for calculating item parameters of deployed CAT test questions

## Shortcodes

Shortcodes can be added to a course in a Text and Media area.

1. To display feedbacks of the past quiz attempts use [catquizfeedback].

The following parameters can be defined:
* numberofattempts=3 // Defined the number of feedbacks displayed in collapsables. Starting with the newest.
* primaryscale=parent // Each strategy defines a scale that is be primary for the feedback. It is used as comparison to averagevalues and values  from other scales. If you display a feedback via shortcode, you can change this primaryscale. You can either choose a specific scale via ID or name, or choose "parent", "lowest", "strongest", "highest" (the second two pointing to the same scale).
* show=questionssummary // Parts of the feedback that are hidden by default can be displayed with the show attribute.
* hide=comparetotestaverage,chart,pilotquestions // Parts of the feedbacks can be hidden. Either the enitre feedback of a section or keys for certain parts. Generators and subkeys are:

'personabilitites' => [
    'feedback_personabilities',
    'standarderrorpersubscales',
    'chart',
];
'comparetotestaverage' => [
    'comparisontext', // You performed better than ...
    'colorbar',
    'colorbarlegend', // Legend of the colorbar.
];
'customscalefeedback' => [];
'debuginfo' => [];
'graphicalsummary' => [
    'teststrategyname',
    'testprogresschart',
    'testresultstable',
];
'pilotquestions' => [];
'questionssummary' => []; // This part is hidden by default.

2. To display an overview table of all scales use [catscalesoverview].
